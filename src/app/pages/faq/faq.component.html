                      Not all Learners are raised alike and not all learn the
                      same way. Hence, we at THE LEARNING HUB tap the unseen
                      potential of your child through Homeschooling. We offer
                      face to face personal training and ensure their growth and
                      development for a better future.

                      THE LEARNING HUB has always focused on Learning with a
                      difference. We have worked with our Learners at
                      Traditional Schooling, online mode and also in
                      Homeschooling programme. We have realized that
                      Homeschooling works the best with any Learner.

                      memorizing it.

                      a home-schooled child. However , this is subject to

                      Home-schooling or Home Education is a term used for
                      students who undergo their schooling from home or a
                      variety of other places other than a School. Parents, home
                      tutor or online tutor usually deliver the education
                      program to students. Home Schools are popular with parents
                      who are not satisfied with neighborhood schools, or desire
                      to have greater control and involvement in the learning

                      offers significant advantages for students - it is
                      flexible, offers a variety of learning experience, ensures
                      greater engagement and personalized attention. However,
                      the most considerable disadvantage is that it can be
                      mostly unstructured. THE LEARNING HUB provides structure
                      to home-schooling along with the other benefits that the
                      system offers. In short it is most reliable.
